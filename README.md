# Project Title
Natural language processing of antimicrobial indications

Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) systems hold large amounts of data. This data can be useful for antimicrobial stewardship, but only if it can be interpreted. Antimicrobial prescriptions with free text indications are a challenge due to the variety of ways a disease condition can be expressed, misspellings, and the use of acronyms. Natural language processing (NLP) is a machine learning methodology which can be used to convert this raw data into actionable knowledge and support antimicrobial stewardship.

This project aims to use R to apply NLP to analyse free-text antimicrobial prescriptions. The goal is to classify these prescriptions into predefined categories based on the suspected source of infection.
